# Integrating deep leep into Classification of Liquid CrystalsðŸ‘‹

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning (DL) framework to classify different phases of liquid crystals. We incorporate a Deep Neural Network (DNN) -to classify (e.g., nematic < smectic < isotropic). To enhance the input quality, we leverage an Resnet 50 to extract features from the images.  The ground truth of the images is used to validate the classification performance, Grad-Cam Approach is employed to add the explainability of the model as well as achieving high accuracy for the predictions.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset of liquid crystal images.
models/: Contains the implementation of DL  models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
scripts/: Python scripts for various tasks such as data augmentation and model inference.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions to get started.

##Dataset
The dataset consists images of liquid crystals captured under different conditions. The images are preprocessed and normalized before being fed into the model.

##Model
ResNet 50
